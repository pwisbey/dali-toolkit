 * \section mainintro_sec Introduction
 *
 * It is a quick and easy way of allowing developers to create Rich UI Applications like Home
 * screen, Gallery, Music player, Games, Maps...
 *
 * DALI is based on OpenGL ES 2.0, however it hides the complexity of
 * the OpenGL API from developers and provides a clean cross-platform C++ framework.

/*! \page scene-graph
 *
 * \section scene_intro What is a scene graph?
 * From wikipedia...
 * A scene graph is a collection of nodes in a graph or tree structure.
 * A node may have many children but often only a single parent,
 * with the effect of a parent applied to all its child nodes;
 * an operation performed on a group automatically propagates
 * its effect to all of its members. In many programs, associating
 * a geometrical transformation matrix (see also transformation and matrix)
 * at each group level and concatenating such matrices together is an
 * efficient and natural way to process such operations. A common feature,
 * for instance, is the ability to group related shapes/objects into a
 * compound object that can then be moved, transformed, selected,
 * etc. as easily as a single object.
 *
 * \section scene_dali How does this relate to the Dali public API?
 *
 * Actors are effectively nodes that receive input (touch events) and act as a
 * container for draw-able elements (which are also nodes) and other actors.
 *
 * For example a Button actor will be an actor with several elements such as button background,
 * text label and button face. When the actor is moved around, it's child elements will move with it.
 * When the button is pressed, the actor will receive an event and adjust the color of its button face
 * element.
 *
 * \section scene_internal Why does Dali internally have a second scene graph?
 * Actors and elements are contained in a scene graph which deals with input, layout and some animation
 * it doesn't perform any drawing.
 *
 * All the drawing is done via the Render Manager which has it's own render scene graph, where it's nodes
 * are just for drawing things like image/text and moving them around. So when you create an Image element
 * it will ask the RenderManager to create an Image node. The separation allows the RenderManager to
 * run in a separate thread to maintain a high frame rate, without being slowed down by any logic
 * performed on the actor/element side.
