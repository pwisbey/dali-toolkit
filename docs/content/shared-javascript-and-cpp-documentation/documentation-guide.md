## Writing documentation for the DALi programing guide

To allow documentation to be shared between C++ and JavaScript, please follow these guidelines:

 - Create a mark down file (.md) using GitHub Flavoured Markdown https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/
 - Put it into the shared C++ / JavaScript documentation: ~dali-toolkit/docs/content/shared-javascript-and-cpp-documentation/~
 - Include code samples for both C++ and JavaScript in the mark down.
 - See multi-touch-guide.md in toolkit for an example
  
Why use GitHub flavoured markdown?
 - Table support is good and language specific code blocks are easier to define ( javascript/C++).
 - Doxygen and YUIDOC both support it.
